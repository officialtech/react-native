### Create project
1. Create project using Expo `npx create-expo-app OfficialTechInitProject`
  - If this message appears `Need to install the following packages:  create-expo-app@*.*.*`
  - Press `y` and enter!

3. `node_modules`: This directory contains the installed npm packages and dependencies required for your project. You don't need to manually manage this directory; npm takes care of it.
4. `assets`: This directory is used to store static assets like images, fonts, and other media files. You can access these assets in your code using the require statement.
5. `App.js`: This is the entry point of your application. It's where your app's main component is defined. You can customize this file to set up your app's structure and components.
6. `App.json`: This file contains configuration settings for your Expo app. It includes information such as the app's name, version, icon, and other settings.
7. `package.json`: This file contains information about your project and its dependencies. It lists the packages your project relies on and defines scripts for running various commands.
8. `babel.config.js`: This file is used to configure Babel, a JavaScript compiler that helps transform your code to ensure compatibility with various environments.
9. `package-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated by npm and helps ensure consistent and reproducible installations of packages across different environments.
